# We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS and provide a json formatted output

#### Since i am familiar with Azure , i will try to write query for Azure metadata
for this i guess we can go to azure data factory and create a function called getMetadata

From get_metadata ## this will be referenced to that metadata from azure data factory 
import get_metadata

metadata_name= AzureAshuData
 i= variables
 v=Azure(Subscription.id)
if variables==keydata,
console.output(subscription.id)
console.output(i)

###### i tried my best to answer this challenges but i am not sure of this how exactly we can get this ######## THANK YOU Team.........................
